## Description: 

Embarked on a mission into learning Python programming language. As I come from an old-school programming era and have mainly messed with just C, Java and C#, I thought it would be fun learning the Python programming language as it has all the hype of Artificial Intelligence associated with it. So, embarked on a GUI Application programming adventure. Didn't really focus on the UI design, just the functionality part.

Kind of fell in love with the huge advancement in technology over the last decade. Must say I havent really written code properly since 2012 and so learning Python was quite entertaining. Thought I'll build a GUI app so as to explore Python's power. I come from the early days of 2006-2008 era when Windows GUI Apps and Web Apps were written in the super heavy and intensive IDE of Microsoft Visual Studio with C#. I remember requiring 5GB hard disk space just to install MS Visual Studio and MS Visual C#. 

So coding Python in Sublime Text was a fucking delight.

As I searched for current GUI technologies associated with Python I met Qt. Must say it is super efficient. Though Qt is best (think fast) used with Cpp but PyQt is quite good enough. Had to use Python's Game Engine called PyGame for the sound functionality. Seems that python doesnt have a good (think proper with all features) sound library. So even though its just a basic mp3 player had to import PyGame and use its Sound libraries which wouldnt be efficient in a production scenario. Again, since this is a hobby project, theres nothing wrong in importing a huge library for sound, I guess.

So, ended up making a basic GUI MP3 Player. 

## Functionality :

*Plays MP3 (continues from where it was paused/stopped)

*Stop MP3 (stops playing)

*Pause MP3 ( pauses )

*Increase/Decrease volume of playback

*Seek to any given time using the time seeker GUI control
