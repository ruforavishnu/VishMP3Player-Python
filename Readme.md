Description: Embarked on a mission into learning Python programming language. As I come from an old-school programming era and have mainly messed with just C, Java and C#, I thought it would be fun learning the Python programming language as it has all the hype of Artificial Intelligence associated with it. So, embarked on a GUI Application programming adventure.

Kind of fell in love with the huge advancement in technology over the last decade. Must say I havent really written code properly since 2012 and so learning Python was quite entertaining. Thought I'll build a GUI app so as to explore Python's power. I come from the early days of 2006-2008 and writing GUI apps for windows in Microsoft Visual Studio with C#. So, when I searched for current GUI technologies associated with Python met Qt.

Must say it is fuckking brilliant. Though Qt is best (think fast) used with Cpp but PyQt is quite good enough.

So, ended up making a basic MP3 Player.

Functionality :

*Plays MP3 (continues from where it was paused/stopped)

*Stop MP3 (stops playing)

*Pause MP3 ( pauses )

*Increase/Decrease volume of playback

*Seek to any given time using the time seeker GUI control
